If you are starting from nothing, and need to establish your social group, draw a group of circles on a page.

Add your name and profession to the circle in the middle. Surround your circle with your Family and closest relationships. Then surround these with your friends, and their closest relationships. If you run out of names ask your group about their loved ones, and learn. If you cannot recall names, professions or interests, ask your group and learn.

If you have more than 60, focus on the closest ones. If you have less, learn about and foster relationships with the others.
