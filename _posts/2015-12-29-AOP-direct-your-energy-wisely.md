We cannot, as humans, guarantee that our effort to help more than our Self, our Family, and our Friends is actually helpful. Donate $100, and $10 may hurt Others directly, $10 may be stolen from Others, $25 may go unused, and the rest may go to a company you do not agree with ethically.

Instead, devote $100 to a Friend or Family, and the help will be more accurately placed.

If you choose to help Others, help fully, or do your best to make sure all of your help is used as intended.
