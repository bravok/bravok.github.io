Finish what you start. Don’t start what you won’t finish.

Action is a form of communication. When you take action, you tell your Self, your Family, and your Friends that something is important to you.

If you do not finish it, you spend your own energy for no benefit, but also risk spending your Family and Friends’ energy to no benefit as well. This is introducing disorder with no purpose, and will soon become part of your character in the eyes of your Friends and Family's.
