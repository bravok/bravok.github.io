Don’t worry about what the Others say or think about you. Your emotions are Yours, not Others.

Treat them with respect, but also understand that people are not great at universal compassion. Only your group knows you well and have the proper standing to assess who you are.

This applies in the other direction too; don’t talk about people you know little about.
