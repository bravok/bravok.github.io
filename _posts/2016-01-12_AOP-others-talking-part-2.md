A woman is going to college. She talks to some other students, and one of them make a passive insult about her nationality.

The woman hears the remark, and assaults the ignorance behind the remark, and spends the next 30 minutes arguing with the other student. She is infuriated, shows up to her next class late, and has run out of time to get food between classes.

This woman does not know Peace.
