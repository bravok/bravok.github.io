A man graduates from high school and is unsure of what to do next. He looks to his Friends and Family, and notices that they all drive cars in need of repair. They each have different stories about bad experiences.

He gathers his money, learns to maintain cars, and starts a small business with this small number of customers. His business grows, and in the down times his friends and family help sustain the business.

This man finds peace.
