Donâ€™t be afraid to express your concerns to a Family Member or Friend. If they do something that hurts you or you do not agree with, your other interactions will create the trusted relationship needed to help come to a good resolution.

You cannot live Peacefully if you force your Self to be quiet when we need to speak.
