If you find yourself without Friends and Family, create your own. If you measure and find yourself surrounded by something other than like-minded people, change this. If you are overwhelmed by an excess of people, forgive yourself, let them go, and rebuild with the oneâ€™s you truly care about.

These principles apply no matter what state of life.
