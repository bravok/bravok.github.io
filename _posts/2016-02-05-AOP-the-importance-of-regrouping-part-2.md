A man joins the Army out of high school. He is assigned to a Division, joins a Battalion, and learns to rely on his Squad and Platoon.

He is honorably discharged, keeps in touch with his former team.

He draws 40 circles, places himself in the center, lists his closes friends and family, and finds it is only five people. One owns a small restaurant that has trouble finding wait staff. He joins the restaurant and works until he gains enough experience to manage people. Along the way he meets other like-minded people and fills his group. This man finds peace.

His story bursts from this page.
