A man joins the Army out of high school. He is assigned to a Division, joins a Battalion, and learns to rely on his Squad and Platoon.

He is honorably discharged, leaves the Army, keeps in touch with his former team, but does not build a new group for himself. He struggles with his civilian life, and does not find peace. His story fits on this page.
