A woman is going to college. She talks to some other students, and one of them make a passive insult about her nationality.

The woman hears the remark, but because her nationality doesn’t define her groups, and the other student isn’t Familiar or Friendly, she disregards the remark as uninformed.

This woman knows Peace.
