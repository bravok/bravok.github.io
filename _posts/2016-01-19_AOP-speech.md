Public speaking induces fear.

Our minds recognize that 50 people in an audience is 200 that actually know the 50. Without a close relationship with the audience, you feel exposed and vulnerable. This is natural.

Public speaking is not peaceful. It's a beneficial exploit. Present when the value to your group is present, directly or indirectly.
