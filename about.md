My passion is to bring compelling ideas to life. I am a commercial technologist specializing in customer-driven delivery. My strategy consists of forward looking architecture, reliable cost/time projections, feedback driven focus, and effective end results.

Career highlights:

* A recurring theme of solving complex challenges in practical ways

* Leadership habits that put people first, knowing that results quickly follow

* Disciplined IT delivery that is easily tied back to business drivers

* Heavy use of prototyping and cross pollination of ideas across industries and experiences
